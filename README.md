# spring-boot-rest-api

We all know in today's world, most web app follows the client-server architecture. The app itself is the client or frontend part under the hood it needs to call the server or the backend to get or save the data this communication happens using HTTP protocol the same protocol is the power of the web.  On the server, we expose the bunch of services that are accessible via the HTTP protocol. The client can then directly call the services by sending the HTTP request. 

Now, this is where REST comes into the picture.  Rest stands for Representation State Transfer it is basically a convention to building these HTTP services. So we use a simple HTTP protocol principle to provide support to CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE data. We refer to these operations all together called CRUD operations.
